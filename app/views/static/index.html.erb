        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        I love to code.
      </p>
      </p>
        I first started coding when I first discovered QBasic in sixth grade. When my classwork was finished, I'd usually gravitate to a spare computer to play games until I was called back to my desk. One day, I was playing a Sokoban clone on an old PowerMac, and I was surprised to see that the &quot;About&quot; page listed the creator as a kid my age.  
      </p>
      <p>
        That very day, I looked up &quot;how to program&quot; as soon as I got home.
      </p>
      <p>
        When university came by, I was one of the few people I could think of who knew exactly what they wanted to study. Unfortunately, my scholarships dried up after two years, and I made the difficult decision to defer the remainder of my education and get a full-time job.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practice of coding for its own sake left my life for a time, but I never forgot it entirely. Once you start seeing the world in code, you see it everywhere. This habit stuck with me through everything I did over the next decade, including my oil and gas plant operator job and my subsequent freelance fiction editing work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January of 2019, I joined a recruitment firm as an IT recruiter. For the first time since university, I was surrounded with coders again on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved talking with coders again. They felt like &quot;my people.&quot; Before long, I'd met the organizer of the local Ruby meetup and started attending every month. Modern web development seemed so familiar, yet so different from what I remembered of the Java and C++ I had learned in university.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's more, I'd found a wealth of resources to learn how to use these modern tools on your own. Free tutorials, full open-source courses, podcasts, and burgeoning online communities offered a path to learn the skills necessary to achieve amazing things in a way that wasn't possible when I left to take my first office job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recruiting wasn't for me, but I'd rediscovered something that was

      <p>
        ...and it was like coming home again.
